# Contribute to SPID Enablement Solution

Welcome, and thank you for you interest in contributing to this project!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem with the solution? Have a feature request? Here's how you can report you issue as effectively as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in open issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been filled.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of SPID Enablement Solution

* The federator you are using

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

* Errors from the logs (both for federator and the proxy)

### Creating Pull Requests

To enable us to quickly review and accept your pull requests, always create one pull request per issue and [link the issue in the pull request](https://github.blog/2011-10-12-introducing-issue-mentions/). Never merge multiple requests in one unless they have the same root cause. Be sure to keep code changes as small as possible. Avoid pure formatting changes to code that has not been modified otherwise. Pull requests should contain tests whenever possible.

## Contributing Fixes

If you are interested in writing code to fix issues, open a pull request and link it to an existing issue.
